# Muir-Glacier
fork Muir Glacier

## Simple Summary
Ethereum Foundation officially announced that the network will be undergoing a scheduled upgrade on block number 9,200,000 for Muir Glacier. This upgrade which follows Istanbul is expected to be activated on the mainnet around January 01, 2020, at Block number 9,200,000.

### Abstract

This meta-EIP specifies the changes included in the Ethereum hard fork named Muir Glacier. This hard fork addresses the impending Ice Age on Ethereum Mainnet and includes a commitment to solving the problems with the ice age more permanently.

## Motivation
The difficulty bomb started to become noticeable again on October 5th 2019 at block 8,600,000. Block times have been around 13.1s on average and now as of block 8,900,000 are around 14.3s. This will start to accelerate exponentially every 100,000 blocks. Estimating the added impact from the difficulty bomb on block times shows that we will see 20s block times near the end of December 2019 and 30s+ block times starting February 2020. This will start making the chain bloated and more costly to use. Itâ€™s best to delay the difficulty bomb again to around the time of expected launch of the Eth2 finality gadget.
